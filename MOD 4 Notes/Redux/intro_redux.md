1. install redux
   1. npm install redux
   2. npm install react-redux
2. use Provider 
3. figure out the shape of state
4. add static version of state using redux
5. connect state to component with "mapStateToProps"
6. figure out how state changes over time, create actions and functions for each 
7. implement actions and reducers


Ultimately, there redux is used to pass state through components
however, there are things like 
- Redux Saga or Redux thunk => api fetching & data storing
- Redux Form, used for form validation
  

However,...
For forms => Formik is better than Redux Form
Fetching data => GraphQL... Look into Hasura
Unstated or React Context API =>
