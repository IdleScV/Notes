It's important to note the difference between changes in state and changes in props. Changes in state and/or props will both trigger a re-render of our React component. However, changes in state can only happen internally due to components changing their own state. Thus, a component can trigger changes in its own state.

A component cannot change its props. Changes in props can only happen externally, meaning the parent or grandparent component changes the values it passing down to its children.
